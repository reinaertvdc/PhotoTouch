Ways in which we thought about the multi-user aspects when using this 
application in group on the multi-touch table:

1. There is a button to add a photo frame in every corner of the table, to make
   sure that every user has one within reach. A new frame will be created in
   the neighborhood of the pressed button and will be oriented in its general
   direction.

2. There is a maximum size for the photo frames, to prevent them from becoming
   rediculously big. (TODO test this)

3. No more than 15 photo frames can be created at the same time, to prevent the
   table from becoming overcrowded. (TODO implement this)
